LeetCode Problem 929: Unique Email Addresses

https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-email-addresses/

Every valid email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the '@' sign.
Besides lowercase letters, the email may contain one or more '.' or '+'.
- If you add periods '.' between some characters in the local name part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name.
- If you add a plus '+' in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored.
Given a list of emails, we send one email to each address in the list. Return the number of different addresses that actually receive mails.
