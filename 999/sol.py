LeetCode Problem 999: Available Captures for Rook

https://leetcode.com/problems/available-captures-for-rook/

You are given an 8 x 8 matrix representing a chessboard. There is exactly one white rook (represented by 'R') and some number of white bishops ('B') and black pawns ('p').
Empty squares are represented by '.'.
The rook can capture only one pawn in each of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) that it is facing, given that no other pieces are blocking the path.
Return the number of pawns the rook can capture.
